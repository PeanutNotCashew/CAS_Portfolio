                            The Jackson Heights Beautification Group (JHBG) is a neighborhood volunteer organization. The branch I volunteer with is the Tree LC group, which takes care of street trees and upkeeps pollinator gardens at schools and the post office. We meet once a week for two hours, when there is good weather.

                            In addition to being able to help my community in a hands-on, visibly effective way, participating in the JHBG is also a way to make new connections with my neighbors and socialize. Where before I only really knew my neighbors through my parents, being a part of the JHBG has allowed me to build my own relationships in my neighborhood.

                            As I have volunteered with the JHBG, I have become more involved in my community. Due to the mentorship of the other volunteers, I have learned about both environmental and general local issues. As a result, I engage with local politics more often, by participating in marches, townhalls, and participatory budgeting. For example, I attended a townhall last year that I learned about through the other volunteers in the JHBG concerning a proposal for the construction of a casino near my neighborhood on park land. And, as shown to the right, I marched against fossil fuels use ahead of a UN meeting on the climate.

                            Of all the activities I've done, I think volunteering with the JHBG has affected me the most. Through the JHBG, I've become more independent and more of an advocate for environmental and community issues.
