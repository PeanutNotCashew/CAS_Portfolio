                This year, I participated in my school's first competitive robotics team since the pandemic. We built a robot for the First Tech Challenge. In the team, I led the coding of the robot.

                One of the accomplishments I am most proud of is an algorithm for robot movement, based on the contents of arrays. This was meant to emulate programs similar to Hour of Code for easier implementation and alteration of different robot paths.

                One issue that I had was that initially, our wheels were not behaving correctly. The source of the problem turned out to be that our wires were plugged into the incorrect locations. This was a learning experience that gave me a new understanding of the interactions between software and hardware, especially since all my previous coding experience had not had a hardware aspect.

                Considering the small size of our team, late start to the competition, and skill of the other schools that participated in the First Tech Challenge, I am very proud of our progress in the competition, which was further than I expected.
