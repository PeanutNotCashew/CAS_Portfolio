                This year, I participated in my school's first competitive robotics team since the pandemic. We built a robot for the First Tech Challenge. In the team, I led the coding of the robot.

                From building the robot, I gained a new understanding of the interactions between software and hardware, especially since all my previous coding experience had not had a hardware aspect. I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish with our robot, especially considering the small size of our team and late start in the competition.
