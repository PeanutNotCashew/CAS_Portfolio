                The Beaverworks Summer Institute (BWSI) was a summer program I participated in that ran for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and 1 month. I attended the embedded security course.

                I really enjoyed being in BWSI because I was able to gain more experience in cybersecurity and meet other people who were also interested in the field. I think that participating in the program helped cement my interest in the field of cybersecurity by giving me hands-on experience <a href="https://github.com/PeanutNotCashew/team_brugh">(project on GitHub)</a> on the implementation of security measures such as encryption in embedded systems.
